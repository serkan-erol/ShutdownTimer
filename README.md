ShutdownTimer

        - A simple scheduled shutdown to help you with shutting down your PC 
    after a download or something similar. 
        
        - It uses Windows' own shutdown.exe
    It is not really different from creating a shortcut of said shutdown.exe 
    and entering command line arguments in its properties tab. Only plus side, 
    with this one, you do not have to go to properties, and you can enter 
    the amount of time in minutes instead of seconds. Saving precious seconds!

        - Now it also has an option to cancel a scheduled shutdown! It does
    the job of 2 shortcuts in one simple program.

        - If you have already scheduled a shutdown via this program or 
    shutdown.exe, and you run this program again to schedule another shutdown,
    this action will override* the previous scheduled shutdown.
    *Note: It will cancel the old one and schedule a new one.

        - It is self-contained, meaning you do not need anything else for it to work. 
    It is 64-bit Windows only. You can find the exe file at: 
    bin/Release/net9.0/win-x64/publish
