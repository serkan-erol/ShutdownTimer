#ShutdownTimer

    A simple timed shutdown to help you with shutting down your PC after a download or something similar. It uses Windows' own shutdown.exe
It is not really different from creating a shortcut of said shutdown.exe and entering command line arguments in its properties tab.
Only plus side, with this one, you do not have to go to properties, and you can enter the amount of time in minutes instead of seconds.

    It is self-contained, meaning you do not need anything else for it to work. It is 64-bit Windows only.
    You can find the exe file at: bin/Release/net9.0/win-x64/publish
