#ShutdownTimer

A simple timed shutdown to help you with shutting your PC down after a download or something similar. It uses Windows' own shutdown.exe
It is not really different than creating a shortcut of said shutdown.exe and entering command line arguments in its properties tab.
Only plus side, with this one, you do not have to go to properties and you can enter the amount of time in minutes instead of seconds.
